# Weblings
Add a little joy to your browser's new tab page.

![Weblings in Chrome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanosullivanuk/weblings/master/weblings2_screenshot.png)

Every time you open a new tab or browser window, one of the Weblings will appear with a heartening compliment, or a lighthearted quip, to brighten up your day. The Weblings are an assortment of characters of my own creation. 

* 🎨 An all new Material inspired design, updated for high resolution displays
* 🔍 Optional search bar, which uses the fantastic DuckDuckGo engine
* ☁️ Options synchronise across your devices using Firefox Account Sync
* 🌈 Larger, clearer images of all the Weblings
* 💬 More compliments, cheesier puns and a sprinkling of additional colours
* ➕ Even more Weblings than before, including a very happy 💩
